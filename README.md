The use of cooperative game theory to attribute a fair value to all channels that contribute to a sales conversion. In this context, a game is defined by a set of channels _**N**_ and a characteristic function _**v**_. Each subset of channels in _**N**_ is called a coalition _**A**_, and the characteristic function assigns a value to every coalition to signify it's overall worth. A coalition's worth represents the payoff that it can generate when its channels work together.

Options for defining the characteristic function include:
* _**<sub>v</sub>(A)**_ is the conditional probability of conversion for each coalition. Estimated by fitting a predictive model on past coalition performance.
* _**<sub>v</sub>(A)**_ is simply the total number of conversions generated by each coalition.

This workbook implements the simpler conversion count characteristic function.
